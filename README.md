## About the Project

- **General purpose:** SceneBuilder serves as a versatile tool for constructing scenes from imported 3D models. Application allows arranging them in desired layout, and even customizing their appearances to bring certain vision to life.

- **Orbit Camera:** Easily navigate inside your scenes using an orbit camera that allows you to view your creations from any angle. Get a complete 360-degree perspective and fine-tune your scene composition.

- **Models Management:** Import your own 3D models. Arrange and position models within the scene with high precision using gizmo. Need a different look? You can customize their appearance to match your creative vision.

- **Cameras for content:** Use cameras within SceneBuilder to capture stunning shots of your scenes. Whether you're showcasing your 3D assets, or simply capturing beautiful composition, our camera system has you covered.

- **Labels for content:** Enhance your scenes with labels. Create a label and place near your 3D models to provide viewers with context or additional information about an element of the scene. Labels can be customized to include details such as model names and descriptions.

- **User Interface:** The intuitive user interface of SceneBuilder ties all its powerful functionality together. Easily access and control features, arrange scenes, customize appearances, add labels, and capture scenes with a user-friendly interface that streamlines your creative process.
